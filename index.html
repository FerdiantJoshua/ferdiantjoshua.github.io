                        <li> Develop both classical & semantic-based search, which utilizes lots of search technologies such as: BM25, optimized roaring
                        bitmap, sentence encoding, semantic vector matching, as well as modern LLMs like GPT4, and Mixtral8x7B. </li>
                        <li> Maintain & design performance vs cost trade-off of the search index, picking the right trade-off for various corresponding use
